# SOLID Principles in Typescript
## Single Responsibility
Each class should have only one sole purpose and not be filled with extensive functionality.
## Open Closed
Classes should be open for extension and closed for modification. You should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.
## Liskov Substitution
Every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
## Interface Segregation
Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they cannot do. Larger interfaces should be divided into smaller ones.
## Dependency Inversion
Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
